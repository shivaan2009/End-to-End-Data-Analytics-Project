# End-to-End Linear Regression, Classification, and Data Visualization Projects

This repository contains three complete projects focused on building machine learning models (regression and classification) and creating a Power BI dashboard for data visualization. These projects demonstrate the full lifecycle of a data science workflow, including data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and business intelligence (BI) reporting.

## Projects Overview

### 1. End-to-End Linear Regression Project
- **Objective:** Develop a predictive model using linear regression to estimate a target variable based on multiple input features.
- **Key Steps:**
  - Data cleaning and pre-processing
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
  - Feature selection and engineering
  - Model training and hyperparameter tuning
  - Evaluation using metrics such as R-squared and RMSE
  - Insights and visualization of model performance
- **Technologies:** Python (pandas, scikit-learn), NumPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook

### 2. End-to-End Classification Project
- **Objective:** Build a classification model to categorize data into distinct classes based on input features.
- **Key Steps:**
  - Data cleaning and pre-processing
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
  - Feature selection and engineering
  - Model training using classification algorithms
  - Evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
  - Confusion matrix and ROC curve visualization
- **Technologies:** Python (pandas, scikit-learn), NumPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook

### 3. Data Visualization Project (Power BI)
- **Objective:** Create an interactive dashboard using Power BI to visualize key metrics and trends.
- **Key Steps:**
  - Data sourcing and cleaning
  - Design and development of interactive visualizations
  - Creation of reports and dashboards for data exploration
  - Custom calculations and measures using DAX
  - Insights generation for business decision-making
- **Technologies:** Power BI, DAX, Power Query
